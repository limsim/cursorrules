# JavaScript Development Best Practices

## Code Style and Formatting
*1. Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)
*2. End statements with semicolons
*3. Use meaningful and descriptive variable names
*4. Use camelCase for variables and functions
*5. Use PascalCase for classes and constructors
*6. Use UPPERCASE for constants
*7. Limit line length to 80 characters

## Functions and Methods
*1. Functions should do one thing only (Single Responsibility)
*2. Keep functions small and focused
*3. Use descriptive function names that indicate action (e.g., createUser, fetchData)
*4. Maximum of 3 parameters for functions, use object for more
*5. Include JSDoc comments for function documentation
*6. Use arrow functions for callbacks and anonymous functions
*7. Return early from functions to avoid deep nesting

## Variables and Data Structures
*1. Use const by default, let when reassignment is needed
*2. Avoid var
*3. Declare variables at the top of their scope
*4. Use meaningful and pronounceable variable names
*5. Use explanatory variables (no magic numbers)
*6. Avoid global variables
*7. Group related variables together

## Error Handling
*1. Use try-catch blocks for error handling
*2. Create custom error classes for specific error types
*3. Always handle promise rejections
*4. Use async/await with proper error handling
*5. Log errors with meaningful context
*6. Never swallow errors silently
*7. Use descriptive error messages

## Code Organization
*1. One class/component per file
*2. Group related functionality together
*3. Use modules to organize code
*4. Keep files small and focused
*5. Use meaningful file names
*6. Organize imports in a consistent order
*7. Separate configuration from code

## Comments and Documentation
*1. Use JSDoc for documenting functions and classes
*2. Keep comments up to date with code changes
*3. Comment complex algorithms and business logic
*4. Use TODO comments for temporary solutions
*5. Document any non-obvious code behavior
*6. Include examples in documentation
*7. Document all public APIs

## Testing
*1. Write unit tests for all new code
*2. Test both success and error cases
*3. Use descriptive test names
*4. Follow AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert)
*5. Keep tests independent
*6. Mock external dependencies
*7. Maintain test coverage above 80%

## Performance
*1. Use appropriate data structures
*2. Avoid unnecessary DOM manipulation
*3. Minimize network requests
*4. Use debounce/throttle for frequent events
*5. Optimize loops and iterations
*6. Use lazy loading where appropriate
*7. Cache expensive computations

## Security
*1. Sanitize user input
*2. Use HTTPS for all requests
*3. Implement proper authentication
*4. Never store sensitive data in code
*5. Use environment variables for configuration
*6. Validate data before processing
*7. Keep dependencies up to date

## Version Control
*1. Write meaningful commit messages
*2. Keep commits small and focused
*3. Use feature branches
*4. Review code before merging
*5. Keep main/master branch stable
*6. Tag releases appropriately
*7. Follow Git workflow conventions

# JavaScript Development Principles

## SOLID Principles
*1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
   - Each class/module should have only one reason to change
   - Keep functions focused on a single task
   - Example: Separate data fetching from data processing

*2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
   - Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification
   - Use inheritance and composition
   - Example: Use strategy pattern for different implementations

*3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
   - Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes
   - Maintain consistent behavior in inheritance hierarchies
   - Example: All array methods should work with custom array-like objects

*4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
   - Clients should not depend on interfaces they don't use
   - Keep interfaces small and focused
   - Example: Split large interfaces into smaller, specific ones

*5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
   - Depend on abstractions, not concretions
   - Use dependency injection
   - Example: Accept interfaces/abstract classes as parameters

## DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
*1. Code Reusability
   - Extract common functionality into reusable functions
   - Create utility functions for repeated operations
   - Use mixins or higher-order functions for shared behavior

*2. Data DRY
   - Single source of truth for data
   - Use constants for repeated values
   - Centralize configuration

*3. Documentation DRY
   - Use JSDoc templates
   - Reference shared documentation
   - Maintain single source for API documentation

## KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
*1. Code Simplicity
   - Write simple, straightforward code
   - Avoid over-engineering
   - Prefer readable code over clever solutions

*2. Function Design
   - Keep function signatures simple
   - Limit number of parameters
   - Use object parameters for complex functions

*3. Architecture
   - Choose simple solutions first
   - Add complexity only when necessary
   - Document complex decisions

## YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
*1. Feature Implementation
   - Only implement what's currently needed
   - Avoid speculative functionality
   - Remove unused code

*2. API Design
   - Keep APIs minimal
   - Add endpoints only when required
   - Version APIs appropriately

## Composition Over Inheritance
*1. Object Composition
   - Prefer composition over inheritance
   - Use mixins for shared functionality
   - Implement has-a relationships

*2. Module Composition
   - Create small, focused modules
   - Combine modules for complex functionality
   - Use dependency injection

## Separation of Concerns
*1. Module Organization
   - Separate business logic from UI
   - Isolate side effects
   - Use clean architecture principles

*2. Layer Separation
   - Maintain clear boundaries between layers
   - Use interfaces between components
   - Follow unidirectional data flow

## Law of Demeter (Principle of Least Knowledge)
*1. Object Interaction
   - Objects should only talk to immediate friends
   - Avoid method chaining
   - Limit access to internal state

*2. Module Dependencies
   - Minimize dependencies between modules
   - Use facades for complex subsystems
   - Implement proper encapsulation

## Fail Fast
*1. Error Handling
   - Validate input early
   - Throw errors as soon as possible
   - Use type checking and assertions

*2. Testing
   - Test edge cases
   - Implement error boundaries
   - Use defensive programming

## Code Reviews
*1. Review Guidelines
   - Check for principle violations
   - Ensure consistent patterns
   - Verify error handling

*2. Documentation
   - Document principle applications
   - Explain architectural decisions
   - Maintain decision logs
