# Testing Guidelines

## Unit Tests
*1. Each test should focus on a single unit of functionality
*2. Test names should clearly describe the scenario being tested
*3. Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
*4. Keep mocks and stubs simple and minimal
*5. Document test purpose and any complex setup
*6. Tests should run in isolation
*7. Avoid shared state between tests
*8. Use descriptive assertion messages
*9. Group related tests in descriptive describe/context blocks
*10. Add tags/annotations for easy filtering and grouping
*11. Add comment to each test stating which class and method is being tested

## Integration Tests
*1. Focus on testing component interactions
*2. Test one integration path per test
*3. Document system boundaries and dependencies
*4. Use realistic test data
*5. Clean up test data after each test
*6. Handle asynchronous operations properly
*7. Document environment requirements
*8. Group tests by feature or workflow
*9. Include error path testing
*10. Add clear setup and teardown documentation

## UI Tests
*1. Test one UI interaction per test
*2. Use semantic selectors (data-testid, aria-labels)
*3. Keep page object models simple and maintainable
*4. Document visual requirements and expectations
*5. Include accessibility testing
*6. Test responsive behavior where applicable
*7. Document browser/device requirements
*8. Group tests by user journey or feature
*9. Include error state testing
*10. Add screenshots for visual regression

## Performance Tests
*1. Define clear performance benchmarks
*2. Document test environment requirements
*3. Include baseline metrics
*4. Test under realistic load conditions
*5. Measure key performance indicators:
   *1. Response time
   *2. Throughput
   *3. Resource usage
   *4. Concurrency handling
*6. Document test data requirements
*7. Include cleanup procedures
*8. Group tests by performance aspect
*9. Add reporting requirements
*10. Document performance thresholds

## General Guidelines
*1. Tests should be quick to execute
*2. Support running tests:
   *1. Individually
   *2. By feature group
   *3. Complete test suite
*3. Maintain clear test documentation
*4. Use consistent naming conventions
*5. Keep test code as simple as production code
*6. Regular test maintenance and cleanup
*7. Version control test data
*8. Document test dependencies
*9. Include setup instructions
